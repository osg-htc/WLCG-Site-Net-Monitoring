# Contributing to WLCG Site Network Monitoring

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!

## Reporting Bugs and Requesting Features

Please open a GitHub Issue at:
<https://github.com/osg-htc/WLCG-Site-Net-Monitoring/issues>

Describe the problem or feature request clearly, including any relevant configuration, error messages, or steps to reproduce.

## Submitting Changes

1. **Fork** this repository on GitHub.
2. **Create a feature branch** from `main` (e.g., `git checkout -b feature/my-improvement`).
3. **Make your changes** with clear, focused commits (see [Commit Conventions](#commit-conventions) below).
4. **Open a Pull Request** against the `main` branch of this repository.

A maintainer will review your PR and may request changes before merging.

## Commit Conventions

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages in the imperative mood (e.g., *"Add SNMPv3 support"*, *"Fix JSON output formatting"*).
- Keep each commit and each PR focused on a single logical change.
- Reference related issues in your commit message or PR description (e.g., `Closes #5`).

## Contributing Site Pages

Completed site network description pages (`SitePages/`) are intentionally hosted on **CERN GitLab** rather than this GitHub repository, to allow CERN-authenticated editing:

- Mirror: <https://gitlab.cern.ch/wlcg-doma/site-network-information/-/tree/master/SitePages>

To submit or update a site page, either open a Merge Request (MR) on that GitLab repository or send the file by email to the WLCG Monitoring Task Force (see [Contact](#contact) below).

See [`Template/README.md`](./Template/README.md) for full step-by-step instructions on creating and submitting a site page.
