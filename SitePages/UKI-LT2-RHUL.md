## Network Overview [Mandatory]

UKI-LT2-RHUL is a Tier 2 site based at Royal Holloway, University of London, UK. 

The site network is within a Science DMZ that is separated from the rest of the campus network traffic at a border router.

The network is connected to JANET (the UK NREN) through a dedicated 10 Gb/s link, separate from the rest of the campus network. (There are actually two links in active/passive failover configuration).

Internal networking behind the router is a 160 Gb/s spine, with individual servers mostly connected at 10 Gb/s.
