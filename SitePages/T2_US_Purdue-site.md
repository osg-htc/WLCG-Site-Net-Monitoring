## Network Overview
The Purdue research data center has 2x100G off campus connections.  LCHONE is on one dedicated 100G connection, all other research traffic is on the other 100G. These connections are connected to 2 border routers via a 100G connection.  There are 2 backbone routers for research connected to each border router.  The CMS resource router at the 2550 datacenter is connected to each backbone router with a combined 4x100G speed.  Purdue peers with the Indiana GigaPop who transports us to STAR at 4x100G and ESNET currently peers to STAR at 2x100G.

## Network Monitoring
