# SITE Network Information
This page describes `**UKI-NORTHGRID-LANCS-HEP**` network information for WLCG use.  # Replace with your site name or suitable introduction line


*Our goal is to understand each site's network and track the sites network use (a minimum of IN/OUT total traffic). We would like to get information in three areas: network description, network monitoring and diagrams.  Once this page is created and updated for a specific site, please add it's URL as WLCG CRIC NetSite Info URL (see list of NetSites at https://wlcg-cric.cern.ch/core/netsite/list/)*

LAST UPDATE (when file is changed, please update): 07-Jul-2023 11:40 BST


## Network Overview [Mandatory; can be brief]

UKI-NORTHGRID-LANCS-HEP is a Tier 2 site based at Lancaster University, UK. The site is outside of the University firewall, on a seperate subnet and vlan. It shares this with the University's computing cluster, traffic is mixed but dominated by grid flows.

The Tier 2 is connected to JANET (the UK NREN) through the Universities "back up" link. During normal operation this means we have exclusive access to the link.

At time of writing this link is a 4x10Gb connection (with plans in action to upgrade).

Internal networking is a 100Gb backbone, with all ports at 25Gb.
