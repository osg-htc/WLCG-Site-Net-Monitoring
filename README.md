# Site Networking Information

The WLCG is trying to organize and collect site networking details in advance of the upcoming series of Data Challenges, the first of which is scheduled for the week of October 10-16, 2021.
This project is intended to provide sites with a *site networking template* that they can fill it to provide needed information for both automated data collection and for experts to review and understand so they can advise sites about possible architectural, configuration or hardware changes might be beneficial.

Structure: we have created two directories, Templates and SitePages, that host, respectively, the site network template and associated guide and the completed site network information pages, to be served by a central web server.

The goal is that sites will "own" their pages once they create them and should regularly provide updates when significant changes are made.
